The history of Frutiger LT Std goes back to the 1960s, when Frutiger designed a sans-serif font called Concorde for the metal type company Sofratype. Concorde was a novel and innovative design, with wide-open apertures and humanist curves, but it did not sell well and was discontinued with the end of the metal type era.

In 1970, Frutiger was commissioned to design a new signage system for the Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. He adapted his Concorde design for this project, creating a font called Roissy, which was more simplified and geometric. Roissy was used for the airport signs, but it was not released for public use.
 
In 1976, Frutiger revisited his Roissy design and modified it for print and digital use. He named it after himself and released it through Linotype. Frutiger LT Std was an instant success, praised for its clarity, legibility, and elegance. It became one of the most widely used fonts in the world, appearing on books, magazines, newspapers, logos, websites, and more.
  
Frutiger LT Std has been updated and expanded over the years, resulting in several variations and extensions of the original font family. Some of the most notable ones are:
 
- Frutiger Next: A revised version of Frutiger LT Std, released in 2000 by Linotype. Frutiger Next has improved spacing, kerning, and weights, as well as true italics and small caps. It also has a larger character set, supporting more languages and scripts.
- Frutiger Neue: A further revision of Frutiger Next, released in 2009 by Linotype. Frutiger Neue has more consistent stroke widths, more open counters, and more distinct glyphs for some letters. It also has two new weights: ultra light and thin.
- Frutiger Arabic: An Arabic extension of Frutiger LT Std, designed by Nadine Chahine in collaboration with Adrian Frutiger. Frutiger Arabic was released in 2007 by Linotype. It follows the same humanist principles as Frutiger LT Std, but with adaptations to suit the Arabic script.

Frutiger LT Std and its variations have been widely used in various contexts and media, such as logos, signage, websites, books, magazines, newspapers, and more. Some of the most famous examples of Frutiger LT Std usage are:

- The Swiss passport: Frutiger LT Std is used for the text and numbers on the Swiss passport since 2003.
- The London Underground: Frutiger LT Std is used for the signage and maps of the London Underground since 2013.
- The National Health Service: Frutiger LT Std is used for the logo and identity of the National Health Service in England since 1999.
